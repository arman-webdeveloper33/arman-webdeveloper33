👋 HELLO, I’M ARMAN
------------------
Welcome to my GitHub space.

This repository is not just a collection of files — it’s a **story in progress**.  
A story of a **Computer Engineering student** who enjoys solving **real-world problems** using programming and technology.

---

📖 MY STORY
-----------
It all started with curiosity.

I wanted to understand how computers think, how problems are broken down, and how solutions are built using logic.  
That curiosity led me to study **Computer Engineering**, where I developed a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.

Along the way, I discovered my growing interest in **web development** — building things that are not only functional, but also useful and meaningful.

To me, code is more than syntax.  
It’s about **ideas, structure, and impact**.
